# Hunt4TheMurderer
Welcome to the Cluedo Flask Game! 
This murder-mystery extravaganza is based on the notorious board game Cluedo, where you'll be transported to Tudor Hall's Mansion, 
a place where murder and mischief reign supreme. Get ready to put on your detective hat, as you and your friends unravel the mysteries and strive to clear your names.
## Game Objective
The objective of the game is to solve the murder mystery by identifying the killer, the weapon of choice, and the room where the 
crime took place. As one of the suspects, you'll gather clues, make deductions, and accuse other players to prove your innocence.
### Technologies Used
This game is built using the following technologies:
