    <p class="text-justify sm:px-40 px-10 py-2">
        Cluedo, the notorious board game that whisks you away to Tudor Hall's Mansion, where murder and mischief reign supreme! Picture this: a bunch of wannabe detectives strutting around in fancy character costumes, desperately trying to clear their names.
        <br>
        So, here's the scoop: old Sir Hugh Black meets an untimely demise, and to make matters worse, his dear nephew, Dr. Black, also bites the dust on his 30th birthday. Talk about a family curse!
        <br>
        Now it's up to you and your fellow suspects to crack this case and prove your innocence. But hey, don't forget the essentials: the killer, the weapon of choice, and the ever-important room where the deadly deeds went down.
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify sm:px-40 px-10 py-2">
        Cluedo is not just a gameâ€”it's a hilarious murder-mystery extravaganza that will have you laughing, scheming, and accusing everyone around you.
        <br>
        Who knew solving a crime could be this much fun? Get ready to channel your inner Sherlock Holmes (or Inspector Clouseau) and let the games begin!
