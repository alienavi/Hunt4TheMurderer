                    Welcome to the grand and mysterious Bloody Castle, perched high on a desolate cliffside, its darkened silhouette casting an ominous shadow over the surrounding landscape. For years, the mansion stood as a symbol of wealth, power, and secrecy, hosting the most intriguing of guests and the most glamorous of parties. Yet, within its grand stone walls, beneath its elegant chandeliers and lavish furnishings, lies a chilling secret that no one could have anticipated.

                    Mr. Bloody, the enigmatic and wealthy heir to the Bloody family fortune, was found brutally murdered in his own castle. The discovery sent shockwaves through the local community, but no one could have foreseen the horror that would unfold.

Despite the police efforts, the identity of the killer remains a mystery—everyone had a motive, but no one can be fully trusted.

Every room hides secrets, and each person has something to hide.
